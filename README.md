# How it works
This program uses Fernet to encrypt the key, making impossible to anyone without a license key use it.
____________________________________

# If its unbreakable, how people will gain access to it?
For example: You can create a website for your product, after the user download the activation program, you can use a method simmilar to phishing website generator, but it will create a temporary webpage
that print the key generated by the code. There is a lot of other stuff that you can do with that code, but its only a template.
